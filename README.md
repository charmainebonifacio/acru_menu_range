# The ACRU New Range Menu Generator

This fortran script allows the user to select a specific range of Hydrological response unite (HRUs) and create a new menu parameter file.

## Context
[Dr. Stefan Kienzle](http://people.uleth.ca/~stefan.kienzle/) created many fortran scripts to automate calibration on the [ACRU - Agricultural Catchments Research Unit](http://unfccc.int/adaptation/nairobi_work_programme/knowledge_resources_and_publications/items/5299.php) model using Fortran 77 language and compiled with Compaq Visual Fortran Version 6.6 compiler.

## Legacy

The purpose is to revise the scripts to Fortran 90 and compiled using the SilverFrost Plato Fortran 95 compiler.
